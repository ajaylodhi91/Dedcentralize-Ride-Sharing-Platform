# Dedcentralize Ride-Sharing Platform

## 🚗 Project Vision

DecentralizedRideSharing is an innovative blockchain-based platform that revolutionizes the traditional ride-sharing industry by introducing transparency, fairness, and decentralization to transportation services.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Decentralized Marketplace**: Directly connect drivers and passengers without intermediaries
- **Transparent Pricing**: Clear, upfront pricing mechanisms
- **Secure Transactions**: Blockchain-powered smart contract ensures trust and security
- **Reduced Commission**: Eliminate high fees charged by centralized platforms
- **Global Accessibility**: No geographical restrictions

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Smart Contract Language**: Solidity
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Web3.js
- **Wallet Integration**: MetaMask

## 🔧 Smart Contract Functionality

The core smart contract provides the following key functions:
- Offer a ride
- Book a ride
- Complete a ride
- Retrieve ride details
- Secure payment handling

## 📡 Deployment Details

### Contract Addresses
- **Ethereum Mainnet**: `TBD`
- **Sepolia Testnet**: `0x...` (Replace with actual deployed contract address)
- **Goerli Testnet**: `0x...` (Replace with actual deployed contract address)
